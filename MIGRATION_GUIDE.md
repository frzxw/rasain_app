# Fix User Names in Reviews - Migration Guide

## üîß Problem Description

Recipe reviews were showing "Pengguna Anonymous" instead of actual user names because:

1. `recipe_reviews` table only had `user_id` but no `user_name` or `user_image_url` columns
2. No foreign key relationship existed between `recipe_reviews` and `user_profiles`
3. Flutter code was hardcoded to use "Pengguna Anonymous"

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Database Changes (`migration_fix_user_names.sql`)

1. **Added Foreign Key Constraint**

   - Links `recipe_reviews.user_id` ‚Üí `user_profiles.id`
   - Enables JOIN queries for getting user data

2. **Added User Data Columns**

   - `user_name TEXT` - stores user's display name
   - `user_image_url TEXT` - stores user's avatar URL

3. **Auto-Population Trigger**

   - Automatically fills user data when inserting/updating reviews
   - Ensures data consistency

4. **Data Migration**
   - Populates existing reviews with correct user names
   - Backfills historical data

### Flutter Code Changes (`recipe_service.dart`)

1. **Smart Query Strategy**

   - First tries direct column access (fastest)
   - Falls back to JOIN query if columns don't exist
   - Final fallback to basic query

2. **Improved User Data Processing**
   - Uses direct columns when available
   - Falls back to JOIN data
   - Provides debug logging

## üöÄ How to Run Migration

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `migration_fix_user_names.sql`
4. Execute the SQL script

### Option 2: Using psql Command Line

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database
psql "postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]"

# Run the migration
\i migration_fix_user_names.sql
```

### Option 3: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
supabase db reset --db-url "your-database-url"
# Then apply the migration
```

## üß™ Testing After Migration

1. **Run the Flutter App**

   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Recipe**

   - Click on any recipe to view details
   - Check the Reviews section

3. **Add a New Review**

   - Log in with a user account
   - Add a review and rating
   - Verify the correct username appears

4. **Check Logs**
   Look for these success messages:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Direct column query successful for reviews
   üë§ Review user: [Real User Name] (from direct column)
   ```

## üîç Verification Queries

After running migration, verify in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if columns were added
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'recipe_reviews'
AND column_name IN ('user_name', 'user_image_url');

-- Check if foreign key exists
SELECT constraint_name, table_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_name = 'recipe_reviews'
AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Test data population
SELECT
    id,
    user_id,
    user_name,
    rating,
    comment,
    created_at
FROM recipe_reviews
LIMIT 5;

-- Test JOIN query (should work now)
SELECT
    rr.id,
    rr.user_name as direct_name,
    up.name as join_name,
    rr.rating,
    rr.comment
FROM recipe_reviews rr
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON rr.user_id = up.id
LIMIT 3;
```

## üì± Expected Results

After migration:

- ‚úÖ New reviews show actual user names
- ‚úÖ Existing reviews get user names populated
- ‚úÖ Performance is improved (no JOIN needed for new data)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ No data loss or corruption

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If needed, you can rollback:

```sql
-- Remove added columns
ALTER TABLE recipe_reviews DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS user_name;
ALTER TABLE recipe_reviews DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS user_image_url;

-- Remove trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS populate_review_user_data_trigger ON recipe_reviews;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS populate_review_user_data();

-- Remove foreign key (replace constraint name as needed)
ALTER TABLE recipe_reviews DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS recipe_reviews_user_id_fkey_profiles;
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Reviews display actual user names instead of "Pengguna Anonymous"
2. ‚úÖ New reviews automatically get correct user data
3. ‚úÖ No errors in Flutter logs during review loading
4. ‚úÖ Performance is maintained or improved
5. ‚úÖ All existing functionality continues to work
